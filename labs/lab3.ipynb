    "\n",
    "Use the Kalman filter to estimate the parameters of the ARMA(3,6) model throughout the year. To do so requires some care. To begin with, do not remove the initial samples when forming $z_t = \\nabla_6 y_t = y_t - y_{t-6}$. Clearly, these initial samples will be corrupted, as always, but we will instead remove these later to simplify the alignment of the vectors. Then, form the Kalman filter predict $\\hat{z}_{t|t-1}$ using the ARMA structure above using the appropriate `C` vector. As\n",

    "yhat[t] = zt + y[t-6]        # \\hat{y}_{t|t-1}\n",

    "Next, you can initiate the model at the beginning of the data set using the parameters you have found from the modeling data. To make the plots a bit nicer, we do this also for the states before the predictions:\n",

    "```\n",
    "Here, the parameters `p0` and `q0` indicate the number of unknown coefficients in the $A(z)$ and $C(z)$-polynomials, respectively. As this choice of initial states should be fairly accurate, you trust your initial estimates to be reasonably good and can thus select a low initial $R_{1|0}^{x,x}$, for instance using\n",

Note that you can (and maybe should?) have different parameter variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the resulting prediction with the result you got above when using the winter model as well as with the naive predictor. As you can see, the winter model is actually rather stable and actually works quite well even for the validation data, even without allowing the parameters to vary. Can you suggest any reasons why this might be?"
